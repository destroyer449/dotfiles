#+TITLE: README
#+DESCRIPTION: Configuration files for all apps I use
#+AUTHOR: Dominic Adamson

* Basic Information
 These are my system configuration files for all of the apps that I use regularly. My Awesome, Doom, Picom, and Dmenu configurations are based *heavily* upon the configuration files by DistroTube at [[https://gitlab.com/dwt1/dotfiles][dotfiles]]. These configuration files are likely to break and as such should be used as a learning resource rather than as actual configs. In other words, feel free to steal these, but at least change them!
 The programs that currently have a proper configuration file are:
+ NeoViM
+ Alacritty
+ AwesomeWM
+ Blender
+ Dmenu
+ Spacemacs
+ Doom Emacs
+ Tmux
+ Zsh
+ Picom
+ OfflineIMAP
+ Mbsync (Inside Emacs configuration)

* Install
** To install the following dependencies are needed:
+ =git= for install and updates for all
+ =fd= required by vim, spacemacs(I think), and doom emacs
+ =ripgrep= required by all editors
+ =rtags= for coc(vim extension) and doom emacs
+ =mu= for email and mu4e in all emacs
+ =hub= for github integration for all editors
+ =spellcheck python-black python-pyflakes python-pytest= (optional) for emacs integration
+ Nerd fonts including: Hack, Dejavu, and Meslo
+ App that config is for: =dmenu, nvim, alacritty, emacs, blender, tmux, zsh, picom, offlineIMAP/mbsync, awesome=

These should all be inside of standard repositories or AUR
